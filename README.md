# gaussian-process

Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a very flexible technique to carry out non-linear regression analysis. 

Here is a [tutorial](https://github.com/jwangjie/Gaussian-Process-Regression-Tutorial) where the topic is explained in-depth.

This repo contains a few minimal Python implementation examples to conduct GP regression.

## content

The following themes are covered: model specification, fitting and feature importance analysis. The example notebooks cover two main case scenarios:
- **GP model with periodic kernel**: model specified with a periodic kernel.
- **GP model with a periodic effect plus additional effects driver by covariates**: model specified with a composite kernel comprising a periodic kernel plus radial basis function (RBF) components.

## installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gaussian-process.git
